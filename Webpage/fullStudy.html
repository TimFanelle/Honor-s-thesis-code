		<h4>This study has been approved by the UNCW IRB. <br>Protocol #: 20&hyphen;0086<br>Expiration date: N/A</h4>
		<p> <b>WHY ARE YOU BEING INVITED TO TAKE PART IN THIS RESEARCH?</b></br>
You are being asked to participate in a research study about the relationship between reaction time, self-awareness, and social behavior. If you volunteer to take part in this study, you will be one of about 600 people to do so. If you are a student here at the University of North Carolina Wilmington, you should know that if you do not wish to participate in this study, it will not affect your standing with the University in any way.</br></br>

<b>WHO IS DOING THIS STUDY?</b></br> 
The person in charge of this study is UNCW undergraduate student, Timothy Fanelle in the Psychology Department at the University of North Carolina Wilmington. Richard S. Pond, Jr., Ph.D., of the Department of Psychology at the University of North Carolina Wilmington is the faculty advisor overseeing this research study. There may be other people on the research team assisting at different times during the study.</br></br>

<b>WHAT IS THE PURPOSE OF THIS STUDY?</b></br>
The purpose of this study is to understand how reaction time is related to self-awareness and social behaviors. </br></br>

<b>WHERE IS THE STUDY GOING TO TAKE PLACE AND HOW LONG WILL IT LAST?</b></br>
	The research procedures will be conducted online via the Psychology Department at the University of North Carolina Wilmington. Your participation in this study will consist of one online session lasting approximately 90 minutes. </br></br>

<b>WHAT WILL YOU BE ASKED TO DO?</b></br>
<ol style="text-align: left;">
	<li>	During the online session, you will first complete a series of brief questionnaires.</li>
	<li>	You will then play a short question game against a partner.</li>
	<li>	You will complete a second brief questionnaire and a measure of reaction time.</li>
	<li>	You will then play another reaction time game against your partner where it is possible you will hear a loud noise (no louder than 105dbl which is within a safe range). The total session should not take longer than 90 minutes to complete.</li>
</ol>
</br>
<b>ARE THERE REASONS WHY YOU SHOULD NOT TAKE PART IN THIS STUDY?</b></br>
	You will be excluded from participation in this study if you cannot devote at least 90 minutes to participate in this study. You will be excluded from this study if you are not at least 18 years of age.  </br></br>

<b>WHAT ARE THE POSSIBLE RISKS AND DISCOMFORTS?</b></br>
	Participation in this study involves no risks beyond those that you may experience in your everyday life. However, you may find some of the questions we ask (or some procedures we ask you to do) to be stressful or embarrassing. As well, you may hear one or multiple loud noises during the study but they are within a safe decibel level. You can decide to end your participation in the study at any time for any reason. If needed, we can tell you about some people who may be able to help you with these feelings. If you feel the need to speak with Dr. Pond, the investigator will put you in contact with him. </br></br> 

<b>WILL YOU BENEFIT FROM TAKING PART IN THIS STUDY?</b></br>
You will receive no direct benefit from your participation in this study other than a better understanding of behavioral science research and knowledge about how such research is conducted.
</br></br>
<b>WHAT WILL IT COST YOU TO PARTICIPATE?</b></br>
	Participation in this study involves no financial costs to you.</br></br>

<b>WHO WILL SEE THE INFORMATION THAT YOU GIVE?</b></br>
	This study is confidential. Your name will not appear on any form other than this consent form. However, it will be stored in a locked cabinet separate from any of the information that you give us. The information that you give us will only be identified with a code number. That code number will not appear on this consent form.</br></br>
	
Your information will be combined with information from other people taking part in the study. When we write about the study to share it with other researchers, we will write about the combined information we have gathered. Some personnel from the University of North Carolina Wilmington&apos;s Institutional Review Board might look at, or copy, portions of your data. While we will make every effort to keep your data secure, any time data are transmitted over the Internet, the possibility of interception is theoretically possible. However, as we noted above, there is no way that they will be able to know that the data was yours since we ensure that your name is never written on any data form. Thus, no matter who looks at your data, no one will ever be able to know that it was yours. As such, we want you to feel completely comfortable answering all questions as honestly as possible. 
</br></br>
<b>CAN YOUR PARTICIPATION IN THE STUDY END EARLY?</b></br>
If you decide to take part in the study, you still have the right to decide, at any time, that you no longer want to continue. If you feel uncomfortable answering any questions, you are certainly in your rights to refuse to answer any question. </br></br>

<b>WHAT HAPPENS IF YOU GET HURT OR SICK DURING THE STUDY?</b></br>
	It is highly unlikely that you will become hurt or sick during the study. 
</br></br>
<b>WILL YOU RECEIVE ANY REWARDS FOR TAKING PART IN THIS STUDY?</b></br>
For participating in this study, you will receive 1.5 credits toward your Introductory Psychology course requirement. 
</br></br>
<b>WHAT IF YOU HAVE QUESTIONS?</b></br>
	Before you decide whether to accept this invitation to take part in the study, please ask any questions that might come to mind now. Later, if you have questions about the study, you can contact the investigator, Timothy Fanelle, at 630-699-3854 or tf8625@uncw.edu. You may also contact the faculty advisor, Richard S. Pond, Jr., Ph.D., at 910-962-3372 or pondr@uncw.edu for questions regarding this study. If you have any questions about your rights as a research participant, please contact UNCW&apos;s office of Institutional Review Board at IRB@uncw.edu or 910-962-7774.</br></br>
<b>RESEARCH PARTICIPANT STATEMENT AND SIGNATURE</b></br>

A rock has crushed the legs of one of her crew members and he will die without medical attention. She&apos;s established radio contact with the rescue team and learned it will be 36 hours before the first drill can reach the space she is trapped in.<br> She is able to calculate that this space has just enough oxygen for three people to survive for 36 hours, but definitely not enough for four people. The only way to save the other crew members is to refuse medical aid to the injured crew member so that there will be just enough oxygen for the rest of the crew to survive.

		<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b>Debrief</b></h2>
		<p style="font-size: 21px; margin-left: 7px; margin-right: 7px;"> Thanks so much for your help today. Now that we are done with the study, I would like to tell you a little bit more about what we were looking for. The current study is about how different areas of the brain impact emotion based attentional bias. More specifically, we are investigating whether different emotions with similar social behaviors differently influence the reaction times of individuals. <br><br>
Furthermore, we expect that individuals who are frustrated will be more likely to respond slower to the color of aggressive words than individuals who are socially rejected. This may have implications for how emotional processing occurs across different parts of the brain. 
Everyone in the experiment was asked to play a virtual game with a partner and a judge determining the better answer. In reality, participants played this game against the computer. During the game, participants are accepted, rejected, or frustrated by whether the judge accepts your answer or not and if the points are allotted to you or not. These responses were pre-programmed, and you were randomly assigned to receive one of three (acceptance, rejection, or frustration) conditions. To reiterate, you did not actually play this game against other people.
<br><br>
Lastly, you completed a competitive reaction-time task in this experiment, in which you were able to blast a partner with noise. In reality, participants played this game against the computer. All responses were pre-programmed, as were wins and losses. Participants do not actually blast other people with the white noise.
<br><br>
	That is basically it, but before you go I just want to tell you that although the conditions in this study were randomly assigned and have nothing to do with you personally, everyone can recall a time in their life when they were feeling rejected or frustrated. You may find yourself thinking about these types of issues and parts of this study in the future. This is normal, and you should know that everyone at some time or another experiences the types of feelings associated with being accepted, being rejected, and being frustrated. However, if you are experiencing negative emotions as a result of today, you can contact the councelling service from UNCW at: (910) 962-3746.
<br><br>
	Once again, thanks so much for your participation today. Your involvement is greatly appreciated. If you have any questions, comments, or concerns please email the investigator in charge of this study, Richard S. Pond, Jr., Ph.D. (pondr@uncw.edu). <br><br>
